# Ultra Marathon Data Analytics Project

## Project Overview

This project involves the analysis of ultra marathon race data. The analysis includes data cleaning, processing, and deriving insights using Python, MySQL, and Looker Studio for visualization.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files and resources:

### Raw Data
- **Filename**: `race_50mile.csv`
- **Description**: This is the raw data downloaded from UltraSignup.

### Data Cleaning
- **Filename**: `data_cleaning.ipynb` (formerly `race_50miles.ipynb`)
- **Description**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the Python code used to clean and preprocess the raw data.

### Cleaned Data
- **Filename**: `cleaned_race_data.csv` (formerly `ultracleanedup_data.csv`)
- **Description**: This is the cleaned version of the raw data, ready for analysis.

### Data Analysis
- **Filename**: `analysis_queries.sql` (formerly `ultra_marathon_project_questions`)
- **Description**: This SQL file contains the queries used to analyze the cleaned data and answer specific questions about the race.

### Dashboard Link
- **Description**: This Looker Studio dashboard provides a visual representation of the key insights derived from the data analysis.

## Getting Started

To replicate the analysis, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- MySQL

### Analysis Questions

The SQL file `analysis_queries.sql` contains queries that address the following questions:

1. How many states were represented in the race?
2. What was the average time of men vs. women?
3. What were the youngest and oldest ages in the race?
4. What was the average time for each age group?
5. Who were the top 3 males and females?

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the process of data cleaning, preparation, analysis, and visualization to extract meaningful insights from ultra-marathon race data. The skills used in this project include data wrangling in Python, data analysis using SQL, and data visualization using Looker Studio.
